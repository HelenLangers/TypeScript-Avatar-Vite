# TypeScript Course

A quick TypeScript course by Joe Previte at https://www.typescriptcourse.com/.

This course isn't focussed on CSS or even the real creation of an actual avatar. Instead, it looks at TDD and the benefit of TS.

## Milestones set out by the course creator

- understand TypeScript fundamentals in the context of React
- know when to use .ts vs .tsx
- test components with react-testing-library
- understand the difference between types vs. interfaces
- understand optional vs. required vs. default type values
- create a React + TypeScript project from scratch

It isn't the most in depth course, but it is a good reminder about ways of testing and error handling.
